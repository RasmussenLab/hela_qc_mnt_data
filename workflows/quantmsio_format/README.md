# Run ibaqpy using the quantmsio_format (parquet)


In order to try ibaqpy on the large hela dataset

I will first have create the parquet file as specified in quantms.io
([peptide quantification feature](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms.io/blob/dev/docs/feature.rst))

```

```

Then the parsed files need to be aggregated into a joint `parquet` file along the 
sample data information from the SDRF file.
